# Read: 08 - Operators and Loops

1. What is an `expression` in JavaScript?
    - An `expression` is a unit of code that resolves to a value.
    - Two types of `expressions`: `expressions` with side effects and `expressions` that purely evaluate.
    - `Expressions` are joined by `operators` such as the equal sign or the plus sign.
2. Why would we use a loop in our code?
    - We use a loop in our code to validate the input from a user.
    - We also use a lopp in our code to repeat functions or commands.
3. When does a `for loop` stop executing?
    - A `for loop` stops executing when the condition we specify results in a `false` statement.
4. How many times will a `while loop` execute?
    - A `while loop` will execute until the user gives us the information that we want.
    - It will run as long as the condition we specify results in a `true` statement
