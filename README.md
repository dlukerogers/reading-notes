# Reading Notes

I'm **Luke Rogers**. I live in Wheaton IL. I graduated from Wheaton College in 2020 with a business degree. For two years I was a project manager at a small digital marketing company where I came across coding as I worked with many developers. I am really interested in coding and would love to make this my career. I love sports and dogs as well!

This website is my reading journal. It is for graders from Code Fellows to see the reading assignments that I complete after each class. It contains answers to reading assignment questions.
