# My Reading Journal

I'm **Luke Rogers**. I live in Wheaton IL. I graduated from Wheaton College in 2020 with a business degree. For two years I was a project manager at a small digital marketing company where I came across coding as I worked with many developers. I am really interested in coding and would love to make this my career. I love sports and dogs as well!

## Growth Mindset

Growth Mindset is an optimistic state of mind that is used when struggling with taking on a task. It is the opposite of a fixed mindset. A fixed mindset is a state of mind a person has that tells them they can't complete a task because they don't have the talent to do so. A growth mindset tells a person that they don't have the skills or resources to complete a task *yet*. They still have the opportunity to grow in order to complete the task.

### 3 reminders for growth mindset

- I don't know this yet, but I will!
- If I don't know something, I can always ask questions!
- Keep trying different things! Don't give up!
