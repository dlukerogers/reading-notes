## What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript  

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.  
  *A syntax error is when you spell something wrong in the code that makes the whole program not work. They usually come with an error message. A Logic error is when you write the code in a way where it doesn't work how you wanted it to. They are harder to fix and there usually isn't an error message.*  

2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.  
  *In the previous lab assignment, I had an error where I was looping a nested for loop into another loop. I should have said `j > hours.length` but instead had `i > hours.length`. I've also had times where I've had sections of code in the wrong place and just needed to move them down to a different spot. I've also had moments where I've mispelled things such as `lenght` instead of `length`.*  

3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?  
  *This topic will continue to influence my long term goals as I will be more aware of spelling errors. In the past I put too much weight in "I did this wrong" and "I didn't set up the code correctly" instead of looking for areas I might have just had a syntax error. I will also use the article to troubleshoot my code whenever I find an error or see it is working correctly when testing.*  

## The JavaScript Debugger  

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?  
  *The JavaScript Debugger tool is something you can use to find spots in your code that you want to look into to find issues or errors.*  

2. Define what a breakpoint is.  
  *A breakpoint is something you set at different spots in your code when debugging your JavaScript code in order to pause the execution and identify problems that prevent your code from executing properly.*  

3. What is the call stack?  
  *The call stack is a section of the JavaScript Debugger that shows you what code was executed in order to get to the current line you are on. This only appears when the code is running.*
