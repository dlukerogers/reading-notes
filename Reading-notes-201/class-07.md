## Domain Modeling  

1. Explain why we need domain modeling.  
  *We need domain modeling because it can verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem amongst various stakeholders.*  

## HTML Table Basics  

1. Why should tables not be used for page layouts?  
  *Tables should not be used for page layouts because they reduce accessibility for visually impaired users, the code is harder to write, maintain, and debug because of all the complex markup structures and tags, and tables are not automatically responsive.*  

2. List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML `<table>`.  
  *`<tr>` is a semantic HTML element that represents the table row section of the table. `<th>` is a semantic HTML element that represents a table header of the table and is nested within a table row element. `<td>` is a semantic HTML element that represents a table cell section of the table and is also nested within a table row element. It stands for table data.*  

## Introducing Constructors  

1. What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?  
  *A constructor is a function called when you use the `new` keyword. Some advantages of using it are they make the code a little more concise since objects can be a little long-winded. They also create and return new objects.*  

2. How does the term `this` differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?  
  *The term `this` differs when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor by the `this` being binded to the new object.*  

## Object Prototypes Using A Constructor  

1. Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.  
  *In a previous work experience, I was*
