## Learn HTML

1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?  
  *We wrap the text or other content inside of `<a>` element.*  

2. The `href` attribute contains what information?
  *The `href` attribute contains the web address.*  
  
3. What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?  
  *Some ways to ensure links on pages are accesible to all readers is to not repeat the URL as part of the link text, not to say "link" or "links to" in the link text, keep the link text as short as you can, and minimize the instances where multiple copies of the same text are linked to different places.*  

## CSS Layout

1. What is meant by “normal flow”?  
  *"Normal flow" means the way the page elements are laid out if their layout hasn't been changed by the coder.*  

2. What are a few differences between `block-level` and `inline` elements?  
  *A few differences between the two are that block-level elements have content that fills the available inline space of its the parent element, while inline elements are just the size of their content. Also a block-level element appears on the line below another block-level element, while inline elements all sit on the same line along with other adjacent content.*  

3. ___ positioning is the default for every html element.  
  *Static*  

4. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.  
  *An advantage of using absolute positioning is that isolated UI features can be created that don't interfere with the layout of the other elements on the page.*  

5. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?  
  *A key difference is that fixed positioning fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport while absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor.*  

## Learn JS

1. Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.  
  *A function declaration is when you create the function in JS by saying `function myFunction()`. A functions invocation is when you tell the function to run by saying `myFunction()`.*  

2. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?  
  *A parameter is the name listed in the function's definition while an argument is the real value passed to the function.*  

## Miscellaneous

1. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.  
  *The first benefit of pair programming is greater efficiency. When you pair program with another developer, you are able to tackle tasks faster and more efficiently. This is because it is easier to catch mistakes with someone else revising the code. This could help me on my coding journey because it can make my code better quality and I can do it faster. The second benefit of pair programming is social skills. Social skills automatically come with pair programming since you are working with another person. I can develop my ability to work with a team or another person and I can become a better socialite. This will help me on my coding journey because it can help me do better in interviews and talking with my network.*
