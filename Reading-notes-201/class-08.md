## Learn CSS - Flexbox  

1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.  
  *This means that Flexbox is used when the layout is one-dimensional or when content is positioned in the same direction (the same line or row on the page). Flexbox helps find the best layout for this content.*  

2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.  
  *The main axis is the axis set by the `flex-direction` property, usually row or column, and flex items move as a group on this axis while the cross axis runs in the other direction from the main axis and flex items move as a group or individually on this axis.*  

3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?  
  *Using certain properties of flexbox like `row-reverse` and `column-reverse` can negatively impact accessibility by reordering the visual display from how things are ordered in the HTML. This is because the reording happens only for the visual order and not the logical order.*  

## CSS Layout - Flexbox  

1. What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?  
  *Flexbox is easier to use than float when vertically centering a block of content inside its parent, when making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width or height, regardless of how much is available, and when making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content.*  

2. How does this topic connect with your long term goals?  
  *This topic connects with my long term goals because flexbox will make me way better at CSS and help me to become a better designer. I will be able to use it in so many different ways that will make the layouts of my projects stand out and, therefore, help me become the best developer I can be.*
