# Growth Mindset

Growth Mindset is an optimistic state of mind that is used when struggling with taking on a task. It is the opposite of a fixed mindset. A fixed mindset is a state of mind a person has that tells them they can't complete a task because they don't have the talent to do so. A growth mindset tells a person that they don't have the skills or resources to complete a task *yet*. They still have the opportunity to grow in order to complete the task.

- I don't know this yet, but I will!
- If I don't know something, I can always ask questions!
