## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming  

1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?  
    1. *Greater efficiency*
    2. *Engaged collaboration*
    3. *Learning from fellow students*
    4. *Social skills*
    5. *Job interview readiness*
    6. *Work environment readiness*  

2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?  
  *In my experience I've found that work environment readiness has been the most beneficial. Although I haven't started working as a developer in a work environment, I know that pair programming is an extremely popular technique used in many tech companies. By practicing now in this bootcamp, I know this will benefit my pair programming skills when I am in the workforce. It has definitely made me more confident in my skills as a driver and navigator.*  

3. How does pair programming work?  
  *In pair programming, there is a driver and a navigator. The driver does the actual coding, while the navigator tells the driver what he needs to code. The navigator is responsible for the overall big-picture of the end product while the driver is responsible for translating this big-picture into code.*
