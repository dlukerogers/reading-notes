## nosql vs sql  

1. Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

| SQL    | NoSQL |
| -------- | ------- |
| Relational Database  |  Non-relational Database  |
| Table based |  Document based   |
|  Predefined schema  | Dynamic schema   |
| Vertically scaleable |  Horizontally scaleable   |
|  Uses SQL  |  Uses UnQL  |

1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?  
  *Complex query intensive environments are good fits for SQL databases.*  

2. Give a real world example.  
  *A large-scale e-commerce platform is a real world example of this as SQL databases can manage and query a lot of data related to customers, products, orders, and inventory.*  

3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?  
  *Hierarchical data is a good fit for a NoSQL database.*  

4. Give a real world example.  
  *A social media platform with user-generated content is a real world example of hierarchical data being a good fit for a NoSQL database since a NoSQL database can easily handle the hierarchical nature of user profiles, posts, comments, and likes efficiently.*  

5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?  
  *A NoSQL database is best for hierarchical data storage.*  

6. Which type of database is best for scalability?  
  *A SQL database is best for vertical scalability while a NoSQL database is best for horizontal scalability.*

1. What does SQL stand for?  
  *SQL stands for Structured Query Language.*  

2. What is a relational database?  
  *A relational database is a database that works with certain assumptions and it supports the SQL.*  

3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?  
  *A relational database works with tables.*  

4. What is a ‘schema’?  
  *A 'schema' is a set of rules that has a set of fields.*  

5. What is a NoSQL database?  
  *A NoSQL database is a database that stores lots and lots of data in a very efficient way.*  

6. How does it work?  
  *We have collections within our database. Then within our collections, we have documents. You can have multiple documents with different schema.*  

7. What is inside of a MongoDB database?  
  *Inside of a MongoDB database exists collections, and within that are documents.*  

8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.  
  *MongoDB is more flexible because you can add more data to the database without a schema.*  

9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?  
  *The disadvantage of a NoSQL database is that there is no schema because you can't rely on your record to have a certain field.*
