## Why diversity matters to your tech company  

1. When are diversity efforts most successful?  
  *Diversity efforts are most successful when they are driven by a commitment from company leaders.*  

2. Why do diverse companies perform better?  
  *Diverse companies perform better because they don't miss out on incredible talent attracting and hiring employees from underrepresented backgrounds. Diverse groups of people bring more experiences and different ways of seeing a problem to a company, which can greatly help the company solve the problem.*  

3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.  
  *An example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base is a clothing company that hires more female developers. Because some female consumers wear different clothing than men, they can create a better user experience for women.*
